We’ve enriched the documentation and instructions so that your Cloud deployment is optimized for simplicity of administration, automation and enriched data cultures following a migration. Designed for ease of use The Migration SDK libraries are available in both Python and .NET. It can be run on both Windows and Linux to simplify deployment.

There are some differences in Tableau Server and Tableau Cloud that can stop some customers from migrating to Tableau Cloud. These recourses are not designed to be conclusive for a complete platform evaluation. Please work with your account team or a Tableau Partner to understand if a migration to Tableau Cloud is not right for you at this time.

Include in this list aspects of the migration (pre-environment screens, matching of content, verification of migration, etc) What to do in Cloud before using the Tableau Migration SDK Need to include the prerequisites before opening the SDK. Get a Site Choose your preferred region Set up Tableau Bridge Configure Site Settings Determine security model (Authentication and Authorization) etc In-Flight Transformations To account for these differences, and to simplify the migration process, many migration steps will transform content as it migrates from Tableau Server to Tableau Cloud. Sentence on what transformers are and define standard and default transformers and how to recognize them. API Throttling Tableau Cloud has published Site Capacity limits to ensure all customers have a consistent performance experience. This includes limits on how many API calls a User can make on a specific Tableau Cloud Site within an hour. The Migration SDK has built in throttling limits to help you plan your migration in a way that navigates these limits. However, in cases where your migration plan exceeds the published hourly limits, the SDK will batch your migration over multiple hours to avoid errors."
